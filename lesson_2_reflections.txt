What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The folder is declared with Git status, which means we'll be able to track it's history through the commits we declare further in time.



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

A staging area is an intermediate between both. As a plus, it offers the capability of making the repository different from the complete WD, in case you only want to save some files or something. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I check all the changes from the SA to the WD. If there are more than one, I make two different commits.
